* transform.position is a property, not just a field,each call internally involves a function call and memory copying (struct Vector3).
   Repeated access to this in performance-critical methods like Update() or methods that might be called frequently (like GameOver()) can cause overhead, especially on mobile.


** System.Math operates on double, which causes boxing/unboxing and float-to-double conversion, which is more expensive on some platforms (especially Android).
   Mathf is optimized for Unity's float type.
   
   if Update function is not needed in a script , do not include it (even if it's empty ) , because Unity will call it every frame , which result in wasting unecessary ressources

   Fix:
   Unsubscribe in OnDestroy():
